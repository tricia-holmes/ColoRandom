### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This project was a massive collective collaborative project, that all participants contributed to in the allotted time given. We were given 7 days to complete this project on our 1st mod in week 4.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Write semantic HTML and efficient CSS to form a usable UI
Write clean, DRY JavaScript and leverage classes, creating and using an effective data model
Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
Refine your collaboration skills
We used the technical language of Javascript, CSS, HTML.
Applied Git Workflow, Google, Turing, our cohortmates :)

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
Technical Wins included: setting up the classes and setting up DOMs, and the CSS styling came pretty easy.
Challenges included bubbling and event propagating to some functions.
As a group, we were able to overcome this challenge through google, the lessons and activities practiced in class, and brainstorming.
